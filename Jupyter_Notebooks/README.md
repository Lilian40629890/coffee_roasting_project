# Analysis
Using three years of historical data, I conducted an exploratory analysis in **Jupyter Notebook**. Using visualization tools like **Matplotlib**, I was able to explore trends and patterns within the dataset. The following are two key visualizations that illustrate the preferences for different bean types and process types:

## Bean Type Preference
This chart represents the distribution of different bean types used in roasting. It provides insights into which bean varieties are most popular and allows for a better understanding of customer preferences.

## Process Type Preference
This chart displays the preference for different roasting processes. It helps to visualize which roasting methods are most frequently chosen, providing useful information for optimizing production strategies.

These visualizations are the result of a preliminary analysis performed in Jupyter Notebook, and they serve as an initial exploration of the data. The goal was to identify patterns that could inform future decisions and guide more in-depth analyses.

## Potential Directions
To improve the depth of future analyses, I recognize the importance of collecting more granular data, such as detailed information on the origin of the beans, roasting levels, bean drop times, and crack times. Additionally, incorporating sales data will provide a more comprehensive view. By integrating these factors, I plan to perform more in-depth analyses, such as correlating roasting parameters with customer satisfaction and sales performance.

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world data, address current limitations, and strategically plan for future improvementsâ€”a critical skillset for business analytics.
